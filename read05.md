# Comparison and logical operators
##### **Comparison operators** make us comparing between two valuse in the java scribt, where the valus will be boolean, true or false. these operators are :
- (==) : means equals to and comparing two valus, numbers,strings or booleans.to see if they are the same
- (!=): means not equals to and it is comparing two valus, numbers,strings or booleans.to see if they are not the same.
- (===): strict equals to means not equals to and it is comparing two valus, to see if they have the same value and data type.
- (!==): strict not equals to means not equals to and it is comparing two valus, to see if they have not the same value and data type.
- (>): greater than,checking if the left number greater than the right on
- (<): smaller than,checking if the left number less than the right on.
- (>=): greater than or equal to,checking if the left number greater than or equals the right on
- (<=): smaller than or equal,checking if the left number smaller or equals than the right on.
##### **logical operators** make us comparing the result of more than Comparison operators,these operators are:
- (&&):logical and: if both expresion are true then the expresion return true, if one of them is false it return false.
- (||):logical or: if both expresion are true or one of them is true then the expresion return true, if both expresion is false it return false.
- (!):logical not: if the Comparison is true it returns false, if it false it returns false.

# Loops 

##### Loops checking the condition; if its true the code block will run and the condition will be checked if it still returns true it repeats until the condition returns false, there are 3 type of loops:
- for: using it when we need to run code a specific number of times.

- while loob: we use it when we dont know how many times the code should run.

- Do while: it is simelar to while loop but has one key differance.
