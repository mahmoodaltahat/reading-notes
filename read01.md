# Mastering Markdown

##### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Gists.
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests.
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension.
