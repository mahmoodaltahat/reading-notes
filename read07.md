# CSS introducing :

#### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

#### CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
-  Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that  indicate what these elements should look like).
-  Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page

# CSS : Color

##### Color can really bring your pages to life. In this chapter we will look at: How to specify colors, 

##### there are three common ways in

- Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very
helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors
- Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable
- Background colors for behind either your entire page or
parts of a page
What you will learn about colors in this chapter will then be
used in subsequent chapters when it comes to looking at
colors of text and boxes in CSS.

##### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. 
##### Understanding Color Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).

##### When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture. The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€”just like on a television screen.

- Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
