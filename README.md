# **Growth Mindset**


##### growth mindset opened pathways to more creativity and possibility and it enableed the setting of higher goals and more achievement.


##### A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning. By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
