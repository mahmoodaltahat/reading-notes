# How Computers Work:

##### computers changes the world at each places and diferant fields,where the whole worled effected by the technology revilution.

##### to know Computers Work we should know several things :

-  **What Makes a Computer, a Computer?:** 
##### A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in **information** is called input, **storing** information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as **processing**, and **spitting out** results is called output.
-  **Binary & Data:**

##### Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1 Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), for example the binary number 1001.

##### Everything on a computer is represented as streams of binary numbers. Audio, images and characters all look like binary numbers in machine code. These numbers are encoded in different data formats to give them meaning,
- ** Circuits and Logic:**

##### All digital computers are based on a two-valued logic system 1,0, on/off, yes/no (see binary code). Computers perform calculations using components called logic gates, which are made up of integrated circuits that receive an input signal, process it, and change it into an output signal. The components of the gates pass or block a clock pulse as it travels through them, and the output bits of the gates control other gates or output the result. There are three basic kinds of logic gates, called “and,” “or,” and “not.” By connecting logic gates together, a device can be constructed that can perform basic arithmetic functions.
