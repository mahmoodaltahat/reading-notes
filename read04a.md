### how to write a java scripit for a web pages.

##### first, the best choise to create a Js  is to keep JS code in own JS file with the extension .js and the HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file. 

### Basic java instuctions

##### JS script is a series of commandes that a computer can follow one-by-one. each set of instruction is known as a statement which should be end with a semicolon.

##### here some example for js instructions
- Multi-line comment:   /* comment*/
- single-line comment:  //
- variables : which are used to store pieces of information from differant data type and using it in the script to assigne a string data for example or integer data to do math relations and so on.

### Variable Data Type:
- **NUMERIC DATA TYPE**: which may be integers or flout.. etc.
- **STRING DATA TYPE**: consists of letters and other characters.
- **BOOLEAN DATA TYPE**: true or fauls.

#### there are six rules we must always follow when setting a variable names:
- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
- The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
- You mustnot to use keywords or reserved words.
- can'n use two variables that have the same name using different cases.
- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the
variable stores. 
- If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

##### here some example for js statement which maybe contans sat of insruction 
- the if statement.
