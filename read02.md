### PREREQUISITES
#### Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

### VERSION CONTROL
#### Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

### HISTORY OF GIT
#### Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.

### GETTING STARTED
 #### Download Git
#### In order to use Git, your computer must have it available. If you already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have the latest version.

#### Git can be installed in three ways:

- Install as a package
- Install via another installer
- Download and compile the source code.

### SETTING UP A GIT REPOSITORY
#### To import an existing project or directory into Git, follow these steps using the Terminal or Command Line:
- Switch to the target project’s directory
- Use the git init command
- To start tracking these repository files, perform an initial commit by typing the following:
- Now, your files are tracked and there’s an initial commit. We will discuss the particular commands in detail soon.

### REMOTE REPOSITORIES 
#### By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

#### By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
