# HTML TEXT :

##### HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page such as headings, subheadings, paragraphs.They also provide semantic information for example where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation.

# Introducing CSS:

##### CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
##### Rules are made up of
- **selectors** that specify the elements the rule applies 
- **declarations** that indicate what these elements should look like.

##### Different types of selectors allow us to target our rules at different elements. And Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that we want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
##### CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# JS INSTRUCTIONS:

##### A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, we might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 
##### Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. And Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

##### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).Expressions evaluate into a single value, expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Decisions and Loops "switch statmement"
##### switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). Data types can be coerced from one type to another. All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
