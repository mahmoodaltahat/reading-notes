# Lists:

##### There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: 
- ordered, unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.

##### Definition lists are used to define terminology. Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes:

##### CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box. we can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. we can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.

##### It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.

##### CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# JS INSTRUCTIONS:

##### A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, we might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 
##### Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. And Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

##### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).Expressions evaluate into a single value, expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Decisions and Loops "switch statmement"
##### switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). Data types can be coerced from one type to another. All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
