# Process & Design
 - How to approach building a site
 - Understanding your audience and their needs
 - How to present information visitors want to see

*********
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
-  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
-  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

##### Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
##### the designer should focus on these Target Audience : individuals

● What is the age range of your target audience:?
● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
● Which country do your visitors live in?
● Do they live in urban or rural areas?
● What is the average income of visitors?
● What level of education do they have?
● What is their marital or family status?
● What is their occupation?
● How many hours do they work per week?
● How often do they use the web?
● What kind of device do they use to access the web?

#### the designer should focus on these Target Audience :  Companies

● What is the size of the company or relevant department?
● What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
● Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
● How large is the budget they control?

#### What Information Your Visitors Need
##### Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

##### To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:
* The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
* The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now.

##### You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

##### You may want to offer additional supporting information that you think they might find helpful.

##### Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals.

##### You can prioritize levels of information from key points down to non-essential or background information.

##### By ensuring that you provide the information that your visitors are looking for, they will consider your site more relevant to them.

##### Therefore, you will have more opportunity to tell them any extra information that you think would be helpful to them (or to expose them to other products and services you want to promote).

##### If you do not appear relevant to them by answering their needs, however, they are likely to go elsewhere.Here are some questions to help you decide what information to provide for visitors to your site.

# How Often People Will Visit Your Site

##### Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

# Site Maps
##### Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

##### The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.
##### To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.

# WireFrames 
##### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

##### A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating wireframes. This involves sketching or shading areas where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins etc).

# Visual hierarchy
##### Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for such as:

- Size
- colores
- style
- images

# Designing Navigation
##### Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
##### Good navigation tends to follow these principles:
* Concise
* Clear
* Selective
* Context
* Interactive
* Consistent

# HTML Structure: 

- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# HTML5 Layout
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
***
# Extra Markup

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- scape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
