# Introduction

#####  Websites Are Created using HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

# wep Structure: 

##### HTML pages are text documents, uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning, these tags are often referred to as elements and usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and a value.

##### To learn HTML we need to know what tags are available for us to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# Extra Markup 
### in this chapter we should know that:

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- we can add comments to our code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

# HTML5 LAYOUT

##### The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describeits structure,The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).

##### Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

##### To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# Process & Design

##### It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

##### Site maps allow us to plan the structure of a site,Wireframes allow us to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

##### Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what we are trying to tell them, we can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style and we can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


# Introduction to JavaScript:

##### JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly.

# ABC of Programming:

##### Before learning how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, we need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

- What is a script and how do I create one?
- How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
- How do I write a script for a web page?

##### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal and to write a script, we need to first state our goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

##### Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

##### Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically,approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

##### computers create models of the world using data, the model use objects to represent physical things, web browsers use html to creat models of the web pages. 


##### It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

##### The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file),If we view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
